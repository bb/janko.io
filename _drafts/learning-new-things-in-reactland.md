title: Learning New Things in Reactland
---

There are too many librarires to try them all. My basic system is:

  - do big companies who are using React (Netflix, Airbnb...) use it?
  - does it have a good reason for implying a constant change, like [react-css-modules]?
  - will it help me avoid large files
  - does it teach me a new programming skill? (e.g. Generators)
  - will I be able to test it better?
