    <p>I‚Äôve used and loved ActiveRecord for most of my Ruby life. While I was in
Rails, I couldn‚Äôt imagine why I would want to use anything else. When I moved
away from Rails, I was still using ActiveRecord at first, but some things
started to bother me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limited query interface, you very quickly have to switch to SQL strings</li>
  <li>no good low-level query interface (Arel is not writable)</li>
  <li>very fuzzy LEFT JOIN support</li>
  <li>it‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/janko/sinatra-activerecord/blob/e7cf306a03c80e12a0632f3d156b911c6ec9d12f/lib/sinatra/activerecord/rake/activerecord_4.rb">pretty</a> <a href="https://github.com/janko/sinatra-activerecord/blob/e7cf306a03c80e12a0632f3d156b911c6ec9d12f/lib/sinatra/activerecord/tasks.rake">difficult</a> to set up ActiveRecord in a
non-Rails project</li>
  <li>dependency on ActiveSupport and its core extensions (you may not want tons
of monkey patches if you‚Äôre using ActiveRecord outside of Rails)</li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted to try another ORM. I‚Äôve thought about <a href="https://github.com/rom-rb/rom">ROM</a>, but I felt like it
required a completely different mindset. I wanted a gem which also implements
the <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">ActiveRecord pattern</a>, but with a better implementation than the
ActiveRecord gem. I‚Äôve heard about <strong><a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/">Sequel</a></strong> before, and I decided it was
finally high time to try it out.</p>

<p>Since then I‚Äôve had a fair amount of experience with Sequel and its community,
and it‚Äôs been amazing. Sequel has all the features I wanted from ActiveRecord,
and so much more, even features I didn‚Äôt know I wanted. Jeremy Evans, the
author of Sequel, keeps Sequel at <strong>0 issues</strong>, and also keeps a mailing list
where you can get help with <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>I would like to give you some of my personal highlights of Sequel‚Äôs amazing
features.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: ‚ÄúSequel‚Äù should not be confused with ‚ÄúSqueel‚Äù. Squeel is an extension for
ActiveRecord‚Äôs query DSL, while Sequel is a complete ORM and an alternative to
ActiveRecord.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-plugin-system">The plugin system</h2>

<p><img class="h-56 md:h-64 float-right" src="/images/sequel-plugin_system.png" alt="Sequel's plugin system" /></p>

<p>While ActiveRecord is one monolithic gem, Sequel utilizes a <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/plugins.html">plugin system</a>.
Sequel consists of a relatively thin <strong>core</strong>, which gives you the most common
behaviour, and you can then choose to add additional functionality via
<strong>plugins</strong>. Each plugin corresponds to a single file included in the gem, but
which is required only when the plugin is loaded.</p>

<div class="clear-both">

  </code></pre></figure>

</div>

<p>Because of this design <a href="https://gist.github.com/janko/58e28d42fb268b0ac3c1#file-03-require-speed-rb">vanilla Sequel loads 5 times faster than
ActiveRecord</a>.</p>

<h2 id="query-interface">Query interface</h2>

<p>Sequel‚Äôs query interface is very similar to ActiveRecord‚Äôs, but much more
advanced.</p>

<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular expressions</h3>

<p>Did you know that PostgresSQL and MySQL have support for POSIX regular
expressions? Neither did I. If you‚Äôre using one of these two databases, Sequel
will transform Ruby regular expressions to SQL:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">name: </span><span class="sr">/future/</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># SELECT * FROM movies WHERE (name ~ 'future')</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">name: </span><span class="sr">/future/i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Case insensitive match</span>
<span class="c1"># SELECT * FROM movies WHERE (name ~* 'future')</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that you can simply replace all your ugly LIKE queries with
beautiful regular expressions! Just note that regex matches are usually slower
than LIKE queries (in my benchmarks they were twice as slow), so be sure to
measure in your application how this impacts the performance. If it does, LIKE
queries are still nicer to write in Sequel (see below).</p>

<h3 id="virtual-row-blocks">Virtual row blocks</h3>

<p>Most of Sequel‚Äôs query methods, in addition to arguments, also support blocks
(so-called ‚Äúvirtual row blocks‚Äù) which gives you a DSL for more advanced queries.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">year</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">2010</span><span class="p">}</span>                        <span class="c1"># inequality operators</span>
<span class="c1"># WHERE (year &gt;= 2010)</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">{(</span><span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=~</span> <span class="s2">"Batman"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">year</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2010</span><span class="p">)}</span> <span class="c1"># OR query</span>
<span class="c1"># WHERE ((title = 'Batman') OR (year &lt; 2010))</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">rating</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">avg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rating</span><span class="p">)}</span>               <span class="c1"># functions get translated to SQL</span>
<span class="c1"># WHERE (rating &gt;= avg(rating)</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">like</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"%Future%"</span><span class="p">)}</span>              <span class="c1"># special methods</span>
<span class="c1"># WHERE (title LIKE '%FUTURE%')</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may be familiar with this syntax if you‚Äôve ever used the <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/squeel">Squeel</a> gem. This
is because Squeel originally borrowed this syntax from Sequel (hence the play of
characters in the name). But the problem with Squeel is that it‚Äôs essentially
an ActiveRecord hack, so it <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/squeel/issues/196">breaks</a> <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/squeel/issues/307">with</a> <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/squeel/pull/354">every</a>
ActiveRecord update. Virtual row blocks are a part of Sequel core, so they will
always remain fully stable.</p>

<p>While in ActiveRecord you often have to switch to SQL strings (OR query, LIKE
query, any non-canonic JOIN etc.), with Sequel‚Äôs virtual row blocks you
essentially <strong>never have to write SQL strings</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="low-level-usage">Low-level usage</h3>

<p>When working with large amounts of data, the time it takes to allocate all these
ActiveRecord objects can very quickly surpass the time it takes for actual
queries to execute. This is often the case in ActiveRecod migrations, where
you‚Äôre operating on whole production tables. Ideally you want to work instead
with light data structures, like hashes. However, as far as I know that‚Äôs not
possible when querying through ActiveRecord models.</p>

<p>Some more advanced ActiveRecord users might be thinking that <a href="https://github.com/rails/arel">Arel</a>, a library
that ActiveRecord uses underneath to build SQL queries, is a good fit here.
Performance-wise it probably is, but Arel is very difficult to use and <a href="https://gist.github.com/janko/2b2cea3e8e21d9232fb9">the
resulting code is often very unreadable</a> (even with <a href="https://github.com/camertron/arel-helpers">arel-helpers</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sequel allows you to write low-level queries using the
<strong>exact same</strong> query interface you use for models! Instead of going through
models, You can go through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sequel::Database</code> object directly, and the
records will be returned as simple Ruby hashes.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">DB</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Sequel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"postgres:///my_database"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; #&lt;Sequel::Database&gt;</span>

<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">title: </span><span class="s2">"Matrix"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">first</span>       <span class="c1">#=&gt; #&lt;Movie title="Matrix" year=1999 ...&gt;</span>
<span class="no">DB</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:movies</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">title: </span><span class="s2">"Matrix"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">first</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; {title: "Matrix", year: 1999, ...}</span>

<span class="c1"># DB[:movies].sql #=&gt; "SELECT * FROM movies"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that with Sequel you can write very readable migrations (because you
don‚Äôt have to <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.8/migrations.html#using-models-in-your-migrations">redefine your models inside migrations</a>), and
have them be blazing-fast!</p>

<h2 id="model-design">Model design</h2>

<p>Where ActiveRecord uses class-level DSL, Sequel instead prefers simple OO
design. For example, the idiomatic way to write validations in Sequel is by
overriding the instance method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#validate</code>:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Movie</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Sequel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Model</span>
  <span class="n">plugin</span> <span class="ss">:validation_helpers</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">validate</span>
    <span class="n">validates_presence</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:year</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">validates_includes</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:rating</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">genre</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"Horror"</span>
      <span class="n">validates_presence</span> <span class="ss">:rated</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I personally find this way of writing validations much more natural than
ActiveRecord‚Äôs class-level DSL, since I‚Äôm not constrained to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:if</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:unless</code> options. As a bonus, if validations become more complex, I can pull
them out of the model into a service object, and still be able to use the
convenient helper methods (since they‚Äôre instance-level).</p>

<h2 id="joins">JOINs</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm not an SQL guru, but LEFT JOINs are really common in SQL. ActiveRecord
unfortunately doesn‚Äôt directly support LEFT JOINs. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#join</code> method only does
an INNER JOIN by default, and while you can use it to write a custom JOIN
statement, it‚Äôs really verbose as you have to write the full SQL string with
all the column-joining logic.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># LEFT JOINs in ActiveRecord</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">joins</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"LEFT JOIN on directors ON directors.movie_id = movies.id"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includes(:directors).refrences(:directors)</code>, which does a
LEFT JOIN, but this also eager loads your directors into memory, which is
unfortunate if you don‚Äôt need that.</p>

<p>Sequel, on the other hand, has support for <em>ALL</em> types of JOINs. You can do
joins through associations, or write them manually:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">association_left_join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:directors</span><span class="p">)</span>     <span class="c1"># association_(left|right|inner|cross|...)_join</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">left_join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:directors</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">movie_id: :id</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># (left|right|inner|cross|...)_join</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="postgres-specific-support">Postgres-specific support</h2>

<p>Jeremy Evans really loves Postgres (as everyone should), and he put a lot of
effort into supporting as many Postgres features as possible in Sequel. And
Postgres has a <em>LOT</em> of features.</p>

<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>

<p>Sequel supports reading and writing to JSON columns, but so does ActiveRecord,
so what‚Äôs the big deal? What ActiveRecord doesn‚Äôt have is an API for
<em>querying</em> JSON columns, which is the reason you‚Äôre using JSON columns in the
first place. The problem is that Postgres‚Äô <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-OP-TABLE">JSON operators</a> can be quite
cryptic, which hurts your codebase. Luckily, Sequel provides a nice, readable
API to help you with that:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Sequel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">extension</span> <span class="ss">:pg_json_ops</span> <span class="c1"># we load the plugin ("ops" stands for "operations")</span>

<span class="c1"># Let's say that the `movies` table has an "info" JSON column.</span>
<span class="n">info</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Sequel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pg_json_op</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:info</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># we create a "JSON operation" object</span>

<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">has_key?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'rated'</span><span class="p">))</span>                  <span class="c1"># WHERE (info ? 'rated')</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'rated'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'PG-13'</span><span class="p">)</span>       <span class="c1"># WHERE ((info -&gt;&gt; 'rated') = 'PG-13')</span>
<span class="no">Movie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_text</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s1">'directors'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'name'</span><span class="p">]))</span> <span class="c1"># ORDER BY (info #&gt;&gt; ARRAY['directors', 1, 'name'])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="views">Views</h3>

<p>Sequel makes it very simple and intuitive to write database views ‚Äì just use
the query interface!</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">DB</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create_view</span> <span class="ss">:recent_ruby_items</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">DB</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:items</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">category: </span><span class="s2">"ruby"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">limit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># CREATE VIEW recent_ruby_items AS</span>
<span class="c1"># SELECT * from items WHERE category = 'ruby' LIMIT 5</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Database views are very helpful for DRYing up some common queries, as you can
query them as tables (Thoughtbot used views to implement <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/implementing-multi-table-full-text-search-with-postgres">multi-table full-text
search in Postgres</a>). Moreover, unlike other databases,
Postgres has <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/rules-materializedviews.html"><em>materialized</em> views</a>, which transforms views
into sort of temporary tables by caching them, <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8OnCH9RMeocJ:www.matchingnotes.com/caching-with-postgres-materialized-views.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">which can really help you speed
up complex queries</a>. Sequel supports materialized views by
accepting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">materialized: true</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DB.create_view</code>.</p>

<h3 id="cursors">Cursors</h3>

<p>Sequel has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#paged_each</code> method, which is an equivalent of ActiveRecord‚Äôs
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Batches.html#method-i-find_each"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#find_each</code></a>. This method is used to iterate over large datasets
without having to load all records into memory. By default these methods use a
separate query for each iteration, changing LIMIT and OFFSET to mimic paging.</p>

<p>Sequel, if it detects you‚Äôre using Postgres, will instead change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#paged_each</code>

<h3 id="sequel_pg">sequel_pg</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_pg">sequel_pg</a> is a gem that provides a C extension which optimizes the fetching
of rows, generally resulting in a <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_pg#real-world-difference">2-6x speedup</a>. So, you just add the gem to
your Gemfile and get free performance.</p>

<p>In addition to optimization, sequel_pg also adds <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_pg#streaming">streaming support</a> if used on
PostgreSQL 9.2. Steaming support is similar to using a cursor, but it is faster
and more transparent. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#paged_each</code> will automatically use streaming to
implement paging if enabled.</p>

<h3 id="other-goodies">Other goodies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for PostgresSQL‚Äôs LISTEN/NOTIFY commands (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/QueueClassic/queue_classic">queue_classic</a> uses
this feature):</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DB.loose_count(:users)</code> for fast approximate counts using Postgres‚Äô system
tables (COUNT queries can be slow on larger tables)</li>
  <li>‚Äú<a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc-plugins/classes/Sequel/Plugins/PgArrayAssociations.html">pg_array_associations</a>‚Äù plugin which enables you to avoid an additional
join table in ‚Äúhas and belongs to many‚Äù associations by keeping foreign keys
in a Postgres array column instead</li>
  <li>and many more‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="switching-from-activerecord">Switching from ActiveRecord</h2>

<p>Sequel has a very exhaustive guide ‚Äú<a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/active_record_rdoc.html">Sequel for ActiveRecord Users</a>‚Äù, which is
aimed at helping ActiveRecord users transition to Sequel. The guide first
explains how <em>each</em> ActiveRecord feature is implemented in Sequel, and mentions
some Sequel plugins you could use in your transition to make Sequel more
similar to ActiveRecord. Then it lists how <em>each and every</em> ActiveRecord‚Äôs
method and option correspond to Sequel. Pretty good, huh?</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/TalentBox/sequel-rails">sequel-rails</a> gem which is actively maintained, which helps you keep
the same development workflow as you had with Rails. It provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Database Rake tasks (for migrations and such)</li>
  <li>Migration/model generators</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sequel::NoMatchingRow</code> error is returned as 404 (some other errors are
mapped as well)</li>
  <li>Logging is integrated into Rails logs</li>
  <li>And more‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even after all of this, I have only scratched the surface of Sequel‚Äôs amazing
features. ActiveRecord was long my ORM of choice only because it‚Äôs part of
Rails, not because it was the best. After using Sequel for a period of time, I
have found it to be much more stable (0 issues maintained), better designed,
more performant (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/simple_orm_benchmark">benchmark</a>), and more advanced than ActiveRecord. It
encourages you to make the most out of your database. I urge you to give it a
try!</p>
